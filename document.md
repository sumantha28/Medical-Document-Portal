Assignment: Full Stack Developer Intern
This assignment is designed to help us evaluate your understanding of web development
fundamentals, ability to build a basic full-stack application, and the thought process behind
your choices. While we don’t expect enterprise-grade production code, we do expect a working
solution, a clean structure, and clear explanations of your decisions.
Please read the problem carefully and provide clear justifications wherever asked. This is not
just a coding test, but also an assessment of your approach to solving real-world problems.
Problem Statement
A healthcare platform wants to build a patient portal where users (patients) can upload and
manage their medical documents (PDFs). These could include prescriptions, test results, or
referral notes.
Each user should be able to:
● Upload a PDF file.
● View all their uploaded documents.
● Download any of the documents.
● Delete a document when it's no longer needed.
Your job is to build a simple full-stack application that allows the above operations via a clean
web interface and a working backend API. This application should run locally.
Core Requirements
1. Frontend Application
○ Form to upload a PDF file
○ List all uploaded files
○ Download and delete buttons for each file
○ Display messages on success/failure
2. Backend API Service
○ REST APIs to:
■ Upload a file (PDF only)
■ List all uploaded files

Page 2

■ Download a specific file
■ Delete a file
○ Store uploaded files in a local uploads/ folder
○ Save metadata to a database (e.g., filename, upload date, file size)
3. Database
○ Store file metadata in a table (e.g., id, filename, size, created_at)
○ Use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or similar
○ No need to implement user login — assume one user for simplicity

Part 1: Design Document (Mandatory)
Create a file called design.md or design.pdf in your repository. It should include:
1. Tech Stack Choices
Q1. What frontend framework did you use and why? (React, Vue, etc.)
Q2. What backend framework did you choose and why? (Express, Flask, Django, etc.)
Q3. What database did you choose and why? (SQLite vs PostgreSQL vs others)
Q4. If you were to support 1,000 users, what changes would you consider?
2. Architecture Overview
1. Draw or describe the flow between frontend, backend, database, and file storage.
2. You can use a simple diagram or bullet points.
3. API Specification
For each of the following endpoints, provide:
● URL and HTTP method
● Sample request & response
● Brief description

Page 3

Required Endpoints:
Endpoint Method Description
/documents/upload POST Upload a PDF
/documents GET List all documents
/documents/:id GET Download a file
/documents/:id DELETE Delete a file
4. Data Flow Description
Q5. Describe the step-by-step process of what happens when a file is uploaded and when it is
downloaded.
5. Assumptions
Q6. What assumptions did you make while building this? (e.g., file size limits, authentication,
concurrency)
Part 2: Local Implementation
Tasks:
1. Frontend
● Upload PDF file (with validation)
● Show uploaded files in a list
● Allow download and deletion
2. Backend
● Store files locally in uploads/
● Store metadata in a database
● Handle all required endpoints

Page 4

3. Database
● Use a simple table called documents with fields:
○ id, filename, filepath, filesize, created_at

Deliverables
Push your solution to a public GitHub repository and share the link.
Your repository must include:
1. design.md or design.pdf with:
○ Architecture
○ Stack choices
○ Answered questions
○ API spec
○ Assumptions
2. frontend/ with:
○ Source code
○ A working UI
3. backend/ with:
○ Source code
○ File handling & API logic
4. README.md with:
○ Project overview
○ How to run it locally
○ Example API calls (curl or Postman)
